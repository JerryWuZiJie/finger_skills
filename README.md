This repository contains some controllers for [NYU finger robot](https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/robot_properties_nyu_finger)

To setup the hardware, follow the instruciton [here](https://github.com/machines-in-motion/machines-in-motion.github.io/wiki/nyu_finger_hardware)

demo folder includes code that implement PD/velocity/impedance controllers to control the NYU finger robots on both hardware and in simulation using [DGH](https://github.com/machines-in-motion/dynamic_graph_head)\
src folder includes RL learning framework for training NYU finger robots to move a box to desired location (under development)
