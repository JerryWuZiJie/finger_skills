test:
    setting:
        gamma = 0.99
        reward = -(box_des + (finger0_box+finger1_box)*0.5)
    result: finger can stick to box, box doesn't move
test:
    setting:
        gamma = 1  # no discount
        reward = -(box_des * 10 + finger0_box+finger1_box)
    result: finger close to box, box doesn't move
test:
    setting:
        same as previous
        reward += 100 if doesn
    result: same as previous
test:
    setting:
        gamma = 0.95  # no discount
        reward = -(box_des * 10 + finger0_box+finger1_box)
        if done, reward_list += 100
    result: same as previous
test:
    setting:
        same as previous
        action space: remove speeds
        observation space: add joint angles
    result: same as previous
test:
    setting:
        same as previous
        max_step = 200 (2 seconds)
    result: the two fingers are touching the box, but shaking
test:
    setting:
        same as previous
        action space change absolute position to relative position
    result: finger way off the box
test:
    setting:
        same as previous
        training samples data from mini batch (size of 100)
    result: finger way off the box


future test: reward to go divide by length; action space remove velocity; observation space include theta for every joints
